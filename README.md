# 3D-MNIST-using-CNN
Classification of 3D digits of MNIST dataset
A 3D Convolution can be used to find patterns across 3 spatial dimensions; i.e. depth, height and width. One effective use of 3D Convolutions is object segmentation in 3D medical imaging. Since a 3D model is constructed from the medical image slices, this is a natural fit. And action detection in video is another popular research area, where multiple image frames are concatenated across a temporal dimension to give a 3D spatial input, and patterns are found across frames too.

We get 3d point data from self driving cars as well.Which are called point clouds from lidar sensor.Which can be trained using various methods such as CNN,pointnet,Voxelnet etc.Pointnets has been seen as a better performance over other architecture.But due to its complex architecture and requiring custom layers to construct we are going for CNN in this project.
